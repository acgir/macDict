Loads and queries macOS ~Body.data~ dictionary files (not included).

This is a port of [[https://github.com/fab-jul/parse_dictionaries][parse_dictionaries]] to C++, with extra links for
phrases, extra formatting, a smaller cached index, and Qt UI on Linux.

Tested on macOS Big Sur and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, with the /Oxford
Dictionary of English/ and /New Oxford American Dictionary/.

In Gnome, the dark or light theme is automatically chosen based on
the output of:

#+begin_src bash
  gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme
#+end_src

* Dependencies

- C++11 compiler (clang on macOS, gcc on Linux)

  On the Mac, install the Developer Tools.

- zlib
- libxml2

  Install with [[https://www.macports.org/][MacPorts]] if it's not already:

  #+begin_src bash
    sudo port install libxml2
  #+end_src

  On Ubuntu:

  #+begin_src bash
    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  #+end_src

- Qt (optional)

  On Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:

  #+begin_src bash
    sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtwebengine5-dev
  #+end_src

* Building

#+begin_src bash
  make
#+end_src

To build without the GUI on Linux:

#+begin_src bash
  make want_gui=0
#+end_src

* Usage

On Linux, copy the ~.asset~ directory for a dictionary from your Mac
(~/System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/~).

Then either:

- Set the environment variable ~MAC_DICTIONARY_FILE~ to the absolute
  path to the ~Body.data~ file, or
- At the top of ~macDict.sh~, edit the default path to the
  ~Body.data~ file in the ~body_data~ variable.

The path must be absolute, not relative, because the
~DefaultStyle.css~ from the same directory as the ~Body.data~ will be
referenced in the generated html.

Run the wrapper script, not the ~macDict~ binary directly.

This opens the GUI:

#+begin_src bash
  ./macDict.sh
#+end_src

On the first run, an index will be built and cached under
~$HOME/.cache/macDict/~. Subsequent runs will read the index and start
faster.

Optionally pass the word to lookup as an argument:

#+begin_src bash
  ./macDict.sh callipygian
#+end_src

To run without the GUI, and generate an html file for the definition
of a word:

#+begin_src bash
  ./macDict.sh -o /tmp/out.html callipygian
#+end_src

To list words for which the given string is a prefix:

#+begin_src bash
  ./macDict.sh -l calli
#+end_src

Use -h to print help.
